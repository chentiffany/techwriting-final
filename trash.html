        <p>My family comes from Taiwan. Our household has always spoken three languages: Taiwanese, Mandarin, and English. Now considered an endangered language by UNESCO, Taiwanese (Hokkien or 台語) has always been the soul of my family and culture. The tongue transcends deeper than just a way of speaking to one another. It is a way of showing love, a method of connection with others, and a tool to create a sense of belonging. The language we speak is cultural, historical, and political power. My grandparents were forbidden to speak it during the Japanese occupation, and my parents were punished in school for uttering even a phrase. </p>
        <p>In Ohio, far from the familiar smells of night markets and the sounds of scooters buzzing around in Taiwan, the tongue brings familiar feelings of home. I grew up with my grandparents in the household speaking it to me, and as my siblings, cousins, and I grew up, I remained one of the only ones who could even create a sentence in response to the other relatives, constantly translating between generations. To me, it is an integral part of my cultural identity, a memory of my passed relatives, and a quintessential aspect of my family and my understanding of our history. </p>
        <p>It's devastating that the language will potentially be lost within my generation in my family and that it is slowly diminishing in Taiwan. In the United States, I've only heard the language outside of my family four instances in my entire life. Writing and learning about language endangerment was incredible; learning about other languages and the stories of each communities' strength and resilience with the language was beautiful.</p>
