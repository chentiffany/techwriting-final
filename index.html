            <p>“Je’intavea’”, Juan said on a sweltering day in 1999 in the small town of Intuto, Peru to his brother, Amadeo García García. Nobody else on Earth understood these words uttered by Juan other than Amadeo. In Taushiro, the phrase meant, “I am so ill”; much like the rest of this tribe settled into the jungles of the Amazon, Juan had succumbed to disease. Once numbered in the thousands, the Taushiro tribe had dwindled to two, Juan and Amadeo, and it was not looking good. “Ta va’a ui”, Juan said finally. <i>I am dying.</i> When his brother passed later that day and asked how he felt, Amadeo responded in broken Spanish with, “It’s over now for us”. He was the sole survivor of his tribe and culture; no one else spoke his language anymore. The entire survival of his culture would be in his hands (Casey 2017). 
                
               </p><p> When Amadeo dies, this is yet another language and culture lost within the area of the Peruvian Amazon. What was once a rich, vast linguistic repository is now an area with more than half of the languages at risk of disappearing, losing at least 37 languages in the last century (Casey 2017). The Taushiro and other indigenous groups have faced various adversities when it comes to the vitality of their respective languages, and it can be reflected in the history of the area and its people.  Language transcends people as it is, “central to cultural identity”. Founding director of the National Museum of the American Indian, Richard West says that language is, “the code containing the subtleties and secrets of cultural life” and it, “determines thought”. It’s critical to value and preserve each language, and with the number of endangered languages and already extinct languages, it has become a priority for UNESCO to implement policies and programs that drive linguistic diversity and honor endangered languages.

                <p>My family comes from Taiwan. Our household has always spoken three languages: Taiwanese, Mandarin, and English. Now considered an endangered language by UNESCO, Taiwanese has always been the soul of my family and culture. The tongue transcends deeper than just a way of speaking to one another. It is a way of showing love, a method of communicating with others, and a tool to create a sense of belonging. The language we speak is cultural, historic, and political. My grandparents were forbidden to speak it during the Japanese occupation, and my parents were punished in school for uttering even a phrase. </p>
                <p>In Ohio, far from the familiar smells of night markets and the sounds of scooters buzzing around, the tongue brings familiar feelings of home. I grew up with my grandparents in the household speaking it to me, and as my siblings and cousins grew up, I remained one of the only ones who could even create a sentence in response to the other relatives in the family. To me, it is an integral part of my cultural identity, a memory of my passed relatives, and a quintessential aspect of my family. </p>
